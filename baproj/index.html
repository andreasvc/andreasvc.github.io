<p>- <b>Abstract</b> </p>
<p>An exemplar-based model of language acquisition is presented, based on a
minimalist meaning representation. The model demonstrates
that semantics and pragmatics in combination with unification and substitution
mechanisms for recombination can account for both
comprehension and production in the two word stage, as well as mimicking the
discrepancy in performance between language comprehension and production of
children in that stage. The model is evaluated by comparing its reaction to
data from the Childes corpus, as well as by demonstrating the interpretation of
novel utterances. Results seem to indicate that sensible utterances can be
interpreted correctly, whereas non-sensible utterance get rejected as
interpretation fails.</p>
<p>Sample output:</p>
<pre>
 <b>Parent: what does a duckie say</b> ?
 	'what does a ?' in '+^ what does a bunny do ?'
meaning initialized as: whquestion: do(X) animal(bunny)
substituted (bunny) with (duck)
	'duckie' in 'duckie .'
	and 'assertion: animal(duck)' matches 'whquestion: do(X) animal(bunny)'
	'say' in 'what does a lion say ?'
	and 'whquestion: do(X) animal(lion)' matches 'whquestion: do(X) animal(duck)'
	interpretation: whquestion: do(X) animal(duck)
possible reactions: ['assertion: do(quack) animal(duck)']
instantiated (X) with (quack)
['assertion: do(quack) animal(duck)']
	reaction: assertion: do(quack) animal(duck)
reduced: quack@o .
	topic: animal(duck)
Child:  quack@o

<h2 id="Pilotimplementation20">Pilot implementation</h2>
<p>I coded a simple <a href="https://unstable.nl/andreas/ai/baproj/model.py">pilot implementation</a>. Its hand-made corpus of examplars looks like this:</p>
<pre>
        'what does a bunny do ?': 'question: animal(bunny) do(X)',
        'dog': 'assertion: point(dog) animal(dog)',
        'want some juice ?': 'ynquestion: want(juice) food(juice)',
        'chocolate': 'assertion: food(chocolate)',
        'throw it to me': 'imperative: throw(X) toy(X)',
        [...]
</pre>
<p>Responses are made in three steps: </p>
<ul>
<li>First an utterance is interpreted, yielding a meaning representation. </li>
<li>Then this representation is transformed into a response using rules. </li>
<li>Lastly this response is expressed in language by trying to match it with previous examplars</li>
</ul>
<p>The last two steps leave much to be desired, but interpretation already performs some useful generalizations. Interpretation works by stitching together fragments of examplars using substitution. The following examples show new variants of the utterances in the corpus being correctly interpreted:</p>
<pre>
Parent:  what does a dog do ?
substituted (bunny) with (dog)
        interpretation: question: animal(dog) do(X)
        reaction: assertion: animal(dog) do(woof)
Child:  woof woof
Parent:  want some chocolate ?
substituted (juice) with (chocolate)
        interpretation: ynquestion: want(chocolate) food(chocolate)
        reaction: denial
Child:  no
Parent:  throw the ball to me
substituted (X) with (ball)
        interpretation: imperative: throw(ball) toy(ball)
        reaction: confirmation
Child:  yes
</pre>
<p>The generalizations do have constraints. For example, a bunny is not a toy, so it can't be kicked:</p>
<pre>
Parent:  you kick the bunny
        interpretation: 
        reaction: 
Child:  eh
</pre>
<p>However, it does not maintain a context, topic or anything else across utterances. Also, there is no link between words and their meanings, only between utterances and meanings. The result is that "want some" is interpreted as meaning "ynquestion: want(juice) food(juice)", even though the crucial word "juice" is missing.</p>

<h2 id="ThesisdraftandPrologversion31">Thesis draft and Prolog version</h2>
<p>I have written the first draft of the thesis:</p>

<li><a href="https://unstable.nl/andreas/ai/baproj/draftpres.pdf">Presentation of thesis draft</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I have also started a Prolog version of the model:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://unstable.nl/andreas/ai/baproj/model.pl">code</a> (Prolog)</li>
<li><a href="https://unstable.nl/andreas/ai/baproj/examplars.pl">examplars</a> (Prolog)</li>
</ul>
<p>The prolog version does not infer a lexicon, and does not keep track of reinforcement, but the advantage is that unification and substitution is much easier and more robust (as it is not based on textual manipulation). The result is 120 lines of Prolog code, versus 530 for the current Python version.</p>

<p>I made a chatbot accessible through Jabber (XMPP) and Google Talk at <a href="xmpp:baproj@unstable.nl">baproj@unstable.nl</a>. No shortage of user interfaces...</p>
<p>I have also been working on the <a href="https://unstable.nl/andreas/ai/baproj/draft.pdf">thesis draft</a>, which now contains the philosophical considerations. I have a strong feeling that the world would be a better place if all documents contained their philosophical considerations, but alas, they do not.</p>
