  abstract="Literary novels are said to distinguish themselves from other novels through conventions associated with literariness. We investigate the task of predicting the literariness of novels as perceived by readers, based on a large reader survey of contemporary Dutch novels. Previous research showed that ratings of literariness are predictable from texts to a substantial extent using machine learning, suggesting that it may be possible to explain the consensus among readers on which novels are literary as a consensus on the kind of writing style that characterizes literature. Although we have not yet collected human judgments to establish the influence of writing style directly (we use a survey with judgments based on the titles of novels), we can try to analyze the behavior of machine learning models on particular text fragments as a proxy for human judgments. In order to explore aspects of the texts associated with literariness, we divide the texts of the novels in chunks of 2--3 pages and create vector space representations using topic models (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and neural document embeddings (Distributed Bag-of-Words Paragraph Vectors). We analyze the semantic complexity of the novels using distance measures, supporting the notion that literariness can be partly explained as a deviation from the norm. Furthermore, we build predictive models and identify specific keywords and stylistic markers related to literariness. While genre plays a role, we find that the greater part of factors affecting judgments of literariness are explicable in bag-of-words terms,even in short text fragments and among novels with higher literary ratings.

	abstract="We present OpenBoek: a corpus of 103k tokens of classic Dutch novels with annotated coreference and entities. The corpus has several properties that are challenging for current coreference models: long documents (fragments of 10k+ words each), domain-specific literary phenomena, and 19th century Dutch spelling. Spelling normalization is added to the corpus as an additional annotation layer, using a data-driven rule-based spelling normalization tool. Normalizations are added using meta-annotation, such that evaluation can be performed with annotations on the original texts without losing token alignment. This tool enables the application of parsing and coreference systems originally developed for modern Dutch. We evaluate parsing and coreference systems on the OpenBoek dataset and find that spelling normalization gives a substantial increase in performance.

The system is implemented as a neural module in an existing NLP pipeline for Dutch literature (dutchcoref; van Cranenburgh, 2019). Our contributions are as follows. First, we provide guidelines for Dutch quote attribution and annotate 3,056 quotes in fragments of 42 Dutch literary novels, both contemporary and classic. Second, we present three neural quote attribution classifiers, optimizing for precision, recall, and F1. Third, we perform an evaluation and analysis of quote attribution performance, showing that in particular, quotes with an implicit speaker are challenging, and that such quotes are prevalent in contemporary fiction (57{\%}, compared to 32{\%} for classic novels). On the task of quote attribution, we achieve an improvement over the rule-based baseline of 8.0{\%} F1 points on contemporary fiction and 1.9{\%} F1 points on classic novels.
